# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

  - communicating frequently with each other and out client
  - contributing equally to this project
  - creating a user-centered website that is in-line with audience/client goals
  - working ahead on the project

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - taking the design journey seriously and designing before coding
    - respecting other team-members and being kind in the ways we communicate
    - each team member is responsible for their assigned roles as well as contributing to the design journey and code
    - if a group member has a busy week they communicate that before-hand and let the team know when they will do their part of the project
    - you can go to office hours whenever; however, if it is after a check-in meeting that the code -support team could not help you then you must de-bug the problem in office hours the next day so we can move on with the project
    - finishes work by 10pm Wednesday

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
  - answer texts witin two hours of recieving unless texts are sent between 11PM and 9 AM then try to respond as soon as possible
  - meet as listed in the design journey
4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - Via email and and  Zoom  meetings will be our main modes of communication

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    - **client liaison**- person who is in-charge of communicating frequently and effectively with our client and relaying that information to the group. They will also be in charge of setting up any client meetings (Caitlyn Johnson)
    - **team/deadline manager** - in charge of scheduling meetings, sending out when to meets, sending out zoom links, observing the work being done and making sure that we are movuing towards are goals and our work is polished, and letting the equal contribution manager know if a deadline is approaching and work is missing  (Chiweta Osakwe)
    - **milestone/project submitter** - in charge of submitting work for the group that is completed and on-time, this person will then have to communicate to the group via email submission that they have turned the project in (Chiweta Osakwe)
    - **code support team** - two members willing to stay after every meeting to help debug everyone's coding issues, they should feel confident in everything we have learned thus far, but don't have to be perfect because its a team of two (Chiweta Osakwe, Caitlin Tarvas)
    - **scribe** - take notes during meeting meeting (Caitlin Tavas)

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - start with general reminder for everyone to get their work done, and then Tuesday night before submission text what specific task needs to be done


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - If we come to a disagreement, each side should first state their reasoning for their decision. If possible, a compromise will be made that both sides can agree on. However, if a compromise is not possible, then the option of those outside of the disagreement should be also taken into account. It is difficult to vote on something in a group of 4, due to the even number and small size. To work around this, if one side chooses to back down on a disagreement decision, they will have a greater say in the next time a disagreement arises.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - To revise this contract, a majority (3 out of 4 members) should agree on the change.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - small dessert after the Friday section on the week that we complete the project?


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
